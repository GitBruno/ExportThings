ExportThings.applescript
========================

An AppleScript for exporting Things database to the Desktop as Things Backup.txt.

Somewhat based on "Export Things to text file (ver 1)" by John Wittig<br />
and from reading the Things AppleScript Guide (rev 13).

Notes
-----

- Tested with Things 2.0.1 and OS X Mountain Lion.

To dos
------

1. Get Repeating ToDos (currently no way via AppleScript).
2. Make tags tab delimited by heirarchy.
3. Export Areas. Maybe.
4. For each exported ToDo, also include their tags and areas. Maybe.
